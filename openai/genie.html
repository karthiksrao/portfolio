            <p>Genie is an <span class="marker-highlight">employee support chatbot</span> built to support VMware's digital transformation by instantly answering employee questions on technology, people, and administrative processes. It became indispensible during the shift to remote work.</p>

            <p class="margin-above">Genie is powered by knowledge bases that are maintained by internal domain experts. Teams across the organization such as HR, IT, Finance and Operations etc have dedicated experts and agents to manage their domain's knowledge-bases and converse with employees via live chat.</p>
            <p>Upcoming changes to VMware's strategy requires Genie to take on an important, customer-facing role. To serve our customers efficiently, we had to <span class="marker-highlight">onboard and empower more admins</span> to manage their domain's knowledge-base.</p>
