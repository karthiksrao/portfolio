				<h5 class="subtitle">Overall Objective</h5>
				<p class="lead">Strategize and design a conversational support platform that empowers experts to create chatbots, convert complex processes into Q&A-based workflows and maintain knowledge bases, reducing dependency on human support by 15% and $2.3M in projected savings.</p>
				<p>VMware Genie is an AI-powered chatbot that was created to support VMware's digital transformation and provide timely support to employees. I was given the opportunity to play the dual-role of Product Owner and UX Designer for transforming the admin experience.</p>

      <div class="project-phase-description">
        <h5 class="subtitle">Goals for MVP</h5>
        <p>The existing admin portal was created by engineers and is not intuitive for new admins to use. Upcoming changes to VMware's strategy requires Genie to take on an important, customer-facing role. To serve our customers efficiently, we had to enable to admins to manage their domain data.</p>

            <h3 class="margin-below">Document the new information architecture, user roles &amp; permissions</h3>
            <p>To make the new features of the admin portal intutive to navigate, I designed the new information architecture. This involved grouping related channels into top-level domains, which could contain multiple knowledge bases, chatbots and conversational flows.</p>
            <p>Based on user input, I also defined the 3 user roles and their permissions: Domain Admin (full access), Contributor (limited access) and Stakeholder (limited read-only access).</p>

            <p>Using the <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a> principles, I created a new component library that builds on top of VMware's <a href="https://clarity.design/" target="_blank">Clarity</a> design system.</p>
            <p>More than 20 new components were created leveraging Figma's Auto Layout and Variant capabilities. This made creating mockups as simple as dragging-and-dropping components from the library.</p>

            <p>Using the newly created design system, I created more than 36 pixel-perfect mockups for the knowledge base, conversation flow, domain management and user management features.</p>
            <p>The mockups also include call-outs that guide developers during implementation. Please refer to the next section below to see some full-sized mockups.</p>

            <p>I recruited 3 admins for usability testing. They were presented with different scenarios such as creating a new question in the knowledge base, adding region-specific answers, managing incoming questions etc.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/rite/" target="_blank">RITE method</a> of usability testing was followed wherein issues are categorized into 3 buckets: obvious issues with quick fixes, obvious issues that need more time to fix and issues without an obvious cause.</p>
            <p>No major issues were found and all minor ones were fixed immediately.</p>

            <p>After the mockups for the MVP features were finalized, I organized a kick-off session with developers where I walked them through the different flows and features in the new portal.</p>
