            <p>There are 3 sides to Source: the website which is used by all colleagues, the publisher portal which is only used by content creators and editors and the search portal. From November 2020 to January 2022, I led the design team that enhanced the colleague experience on each side of Source.</p>

            <p>For this case study, I will focus on the <span class="marker-highlight">article composer</span>  within the content management side of Source.</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Challenges</h5>
            <p>Source is built on Drupal which is a popular content management system. Drupal's UI can be customized heavily, however the article creation interface that was implemented for Source left a lot to be desired. Through user interviews, we identified the following challenges:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Unintuitive interface layout -</strong></span> the current interface is basically a collection of input fields which is not organized in any logical manner.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Confusing field labels -</strong></span> some labels don't accurately describe what type of information needs to be entered. This has led to tribal knowledge among experienced authos and made it hard for new authors to compose an article.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Redundant or legacy input fields -</strong></span> a lot of unnecessary fields continue to add to the UI clutter and confuse new authors.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Burden of formatting -</strong></span> it is up to the author to format their article to appear visually pleasing when published. This requires the authors to use Word or other applications for formatting content before pasting it into Source.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="nomarginbelow">My role was to define the UX vision for the next version of the content management system. The Source team adopted a phased approach for the overhaul and decided to focus on the article composer first due to it's frequency of use.</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Target Audience</h5>
            <p>The target audience of the new article composer is made up of only a small group of employees who post communications on behalf of their business group. We had direct access to a handful of authors in the Employee Communications team. Since they are the most experienced users, we <span class="marker-highlight">conducted 1:1 interviews</span> to get their feedback on the old interface.</p>

            <p>Here are some quotes from our interviews:</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Concept</h5>
            <p class="lead margin-below-large">An intuitive and modular content management experience made possible by a new UI layer called Source Studio.</p>


            <p>I proposed the concept of Source Studio - a completely <span class="marker-highlight">redesigned UI layer</span> on top of Drupal which will provide an intuitive and modular experience. It is intuitive because anyone can start using it without needing formal training. It is modular because any piece of content can be easily formatted and reorganized.</p>

            <div class="photo-frame">
                <img src="images/projects/source/new-landing.png" />
                <p>Concept for the new landing page</p>
            </div>

            <p>The article composer shows the principles behind Source Studio - intuitiveness and modularity - in action. Our goals and approach for the redesign were:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight">Take away the burden of formatting</span> from the author by converting each piece of content - paragraph of text, a quote, photograph with caption etc - into a separate widget that can be placed in the content "stack".</li>
                <li>The order of widgets in the stack can be changed easily by just dragging-and-dropping, <span class="marker-highlight">providing flexibility to the author</span>.</li>
                <li>The layout of the composer is similar to the published article view. This enables us to show a <span class="marker-highlight">real-time preview of the article's appearance</span> on the website, reducing the need to preview the article in a separate tab.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight">Reduce the number of input fields</span> by eliminating legacy and redundant fields.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>The redesigned article composer</p>
            </div>
            -->

            <p>To ensure our design is scalable yet easy to manage, I <span class="marker-highlight">created a custom design system</span>. We adapted the <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design principles</a> for our needs and created <em>widgets</em> which are made up of <em>patterns</em> which contain individual <em>components</em>.</p>

                <p>The Source Studio design system</p>
            </div>

            <p>We leveraged new features in Figma such as Variants to create different states of our widgets and components. This proved to be an <span class="marker-highlight">effective way to hand off the design to the engineering team</span>, because it clearly illustrates the changes that should happen in each state. Using Variants also makes it easy to create and <span class="marker-highlight">manage prototypes used for testing</span>.</p>
