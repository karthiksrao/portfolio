            <h5 class="subtitle">Challenges</h5>
            <p>Using a ticketing system to order hardware posed the following challenges to colleagues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Confusion around entry point -</strong></span> There are multiple entry points for a colleague to start the hardware procurement process, such as the IT webpages on the company's intranet, ticketing system or directly on the hardware vendor's website.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>No clarity of available devices -</strong></span> Depending on the colleague's point of entry, accessing a comprehensive list of approved devices can be challenging. Even within the intranet website, there are different catalogs.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Dependency on external sites -</strong></span> To make informed decisions, colleagues search the product on Google, Amazon or YouTube. Cognitive load is increased when remembering model numbers while switching between tabs.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Too many applications -</strong></span> It is very taxing to juggle between multiple entry points, review sources and procurement platforms and it is confusing to know when to use which tool.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <hr class="margin-above-largest" />


        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Target Audience</h5>
            <p>The new process would be used globally by all VMware employees to procure IT hardware. However, the old process varied region by region. I <span class="marker-highlight">partnered with our user research team</span> to understand the region-specific pain points and challenges.</p>
        </div>


        <hr class="margin-above-largest" />


        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">User Research</h5>
            <p>We conducted usability tests where the participant was presented with 4 common procurement scenarios in order to <span class="marker-highlight">capture metrics such as time to completion, task success and error rates</span>. We also kept track of the number of different web applications and browser tabs they had to open to complete each scenario.</p>

            <p>After reviewing the data collected, we are able to illustrate the old process as shown below.</p>

            <img src="images/projects/oasis/old-process.png" width="100%" />
        </div>

        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Insights from Interviews</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>It takes a <span class="marker-highlight">long time to find available devices</span> and choose the right one device for their workspace.</li>
                <li>There's a <span class="marker-highlight">significant increase in cognitive load</span> when trying to compare options.</li>
                <li>There's a <span class="marker-highlight">lack of transparency</span> in the process after an order is placed. Colleagues are unaware of approval status or shipping updates.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on the insights above, we identified the user requirements for the new process. These requirements <span class="marker-highlight">influcenced the IT hardware team's decision</span> to implement an online store powered by Magento.</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Concept</h5>
            <p class="lead margin-below-large">The Oasis Store is an online technology store that provides a frictionless, end-to-end experience for ordering IT equipment - all within a single browser tab. It is the face of the new IT procurement process.</p>

        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Benefits provided by Oasis Store</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Clarity of entry point -</strong></span> It's the single entry-point for the procurement process and provides a consistent and intuitive experiences for colleagues in all regions.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Reduced cognitive load -</strong></span> New features such as Oasis Expert Opinion and product comparisons enable all employees to make better, informed decisions while purchasing a product.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>A single touchpoint -</strong></span> Reducing the number of applications involved down to one well-designed portal will make maintenance easier for the business.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The new workflow can be illustrated as shown below, with most steps being completed within the same application.</p>

        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Product features influenced by user research & strategy</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Oasis Expert Opinion -</strong></span> A brief description about the pros and cons of each product by an Oasis team member. It helps guide colleagues to pick a device that is right for them.</li>
                <li><span class="marker-highlight"><strong>Product specifications &amp; comparison -</strong></span> product specifications are provided on the same page along with the capability to compare with similar products. This avoids the need to go to external websites.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My role at this stage was to customize the theme of the online store CMS to adhere to VMware's brand guidelines. I also <span class="marker-highlight">wrote code for new widgets</span> that added functionality on the homepage and in the sidebar of other pages.</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle margin-above-largest">How usable is Oasis Store?</h5>

            <p>To validate the efficacy of the provided functions and identify potential areas for improvement, I partnered with the research team to <span class="marker-highlight">conduct a series of tests to determine base usability</span> of key task flows. We also <span class="marker-highlight">conducted surveys</span> and provided a feedback form in the online store to gather qualitative and quantitative data.</p>

            <p>We recruited 10 usability test participants and presented them with different scenarios: order a laptop &amp; peripherals, change default shipping address, compare 2 or more products, order a custom laptop and approve team requests.</p>

            <p>Here's what we concluded based on input from the research participants:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Users typically like the overall look of the new Oasis Store and find navigation easy and understandable.</li>
                <li>Colleagues do not need much time to get around the store and search for the necessary equipment.</li>
                <li>Thinking about their previous experience when ordering devices, colleagues share that the experience with Oasis Store is a definitive improvement.</li>

        <div class="project-phase-description">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Challenges and Areas of Improvement</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve transparency by providing order approval and shipping status on the homepage.</li>
